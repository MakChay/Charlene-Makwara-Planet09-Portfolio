        My coding journey began as a self-taught developer, driven by curiosity and a passion for technology. I started with basic HTML and CSS, gradually moving to JavaScript, React, and backend technologies like Node.js. Each project and challenge has helped me grow, not just as a coder, but as a problem solver and collaborator.
